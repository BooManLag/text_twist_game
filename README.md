This is a README file for the Text Twist game built using the Flutter framework. Text Twist is a word puzzle game where players have to guess words by rearranging a set of given letters.

## Features

- **Five Levels of Difficulty:** The game offers five levels of difficulty, ranging from easy to hard. Each level presents a different challenge by varying the number of letters and the complexity of the words.

- **Time Limit:** Players must guess as many words as they can within a specified time limit. The time limit decreases as the difficulty level increases, making the game more challenging.

- **Word List:** The game utilizes an extensive word list to generate words for each level. This ensures that the words are valid and recognized by the game. The word list is regularly updated to include new words and maintain a diverse vocabulary.

- **Hint System:** If players are stuck and struggling to find a word, they can utilize the hint system. The hint system provides a clue about the word, helping players progress in the game.

- **Scoring System:** Players are awarded points based on the length and complexity of the words they guess. Longer and more challenging words result in higher scores. The game keeps track of the player's highest score and displays it on the leaderboard.
